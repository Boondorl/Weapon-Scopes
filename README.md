# Weapon Scopes
A library meant to serve as a base for scopes that accurately track player and weapon movement. Can be used with the new weapon scaling and rotating options allowing scopes to be seamlessly added into smooth animations. This resource can be freely used and modified in projects so long as it follows the included MIT license.

# Features
* Tracks weapon offsetting, scaling, rotating, and render style
* Full tracking and offsetting for player movement, yaw, pitch, and even roll
* Support for both interpolated and non-interpolated motion on almost all actions
* Extensive helper functions allowing modders to quickly get into modifying their weapon scope logic straight from the states (including zoom level)
* Easy-to-apply scope texture that can be rendered on top of regular scope
* Scales correctly with all resolutions and viewports
