# Weapon Scopes
A resource meant to serve as a base for scopes that accurately track player and weapon movement.

**Note:** This is not meant to be used as is. Needing modifications should be expected as this is mainly a way to outline how to get a weapon scope to sway with the player's weapon and camera movement. Included are example weapons for Doom that show how it draws on the screen and a way to set up and pass the correct information to the renderer.

This resource can be freely used and modified in projects so long as it follows the included MIT license.
